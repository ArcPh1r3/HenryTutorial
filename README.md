## HenryMod
- Adds Henry, a stickman who fights with a mix of sword and gun(at least he will when his skills are implemented)
- Designed to use as a base for creating your own custom characters, codebase is modular and easy to understand while easily supporting multiple characters and even enemies eventually- in other words, Example Survivor 2
- Currently uses Commando's skills, custom skills will be added in later
